@inproceedings{Mistler2001,
abstract = {This paper presents a nonlinear dynamic model for a four rotors helicopter in a form suited for control de- sign. We show that the input-output decoupling prob- lem is not solvable for this model by means of a static state feedback control law. Then, a dynamic feed- back controller is developed which render the closed- loop system linear, controllable and nonintemctive af- ter a change of coordinates in the state-space. Finally, the stability and the robustness of the proposed control law in the presence of uind, turbulences and pammet- ric uncertainties is analyzed through a simulated case study.},
