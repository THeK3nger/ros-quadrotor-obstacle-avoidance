# ROS Quadrotor Obstacle Avoidance

**This repo is an archive for a very old project I did for a University course. I canno guarantee that this project still works with the current version of ROS (probably not!) or any additional work on it.**

**For more info, I have included [the original PDF report (in Italian)](./report/quadreport.pdf). Unfortunately, this is in Italian. If somebody wants to do a PR to translate that, I'll include it.**

**But as I said, the project is very old. The best things you can extract from this is the `cpp` feedback linearization code and include it in a new project based on a recent ROS version.**
